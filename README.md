# Library - Full Stack Application

## Overview

This project is a Library Management System implemented as a full-stack application. The application consists of a backend built with Spring Boot and a frontend implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React. The application provides a comprehensive solution for managing library resources, users, and rentals, with authentication and role-based access control.

The backend is divided into two modules: REST and DTO, while the frontend is a separate React application. The system supports CRUD operations for users and resources, rental management, and user authentication. It also includes advanced features such as JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and secure data transmission. The frontend application was built using **React** framework, **Shadcn UI** for re-built components and **Bootstrap** for styling.

## Key Features

### Backend (Spring Boot)

Among the newly added features are:

- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication. AuthenticationController with login method added to handle authentication.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control. BookController, UserController, RentController modified to include @PreAuthorize annotation with role parameter.

### Frontend (React)

- **User Interface**: Intuitive and responsive UI for managing users, books, and rentals.
- **Role-Based Views**: Different views and functionalities based on user roles (Admin, Librarian, Reader).
- **Authentication**: Login, logout, and password change functionality.
- **Form Validation**: Validation for user inputs in forms.
- **Modals and Alerts**: Confirmation modals for critical actions and alerts for user feedback.
- **Routing**: Protected routes based on user roles and authentication status.
- **Axios Integration**: Custom Axios instance for secure API communication with JWT tokens.
- **Context API**: UserContext and AlertContext for managing user state and displaying alerts.

## Project Structure

### Backend (new features)

1. **Controllers**:
   - `AuthenticationController`: Handles login and JWT token generation.
2. **Security**:
   - `SecurityConfig`: Configures security filters and authentication.
   - `JwtProvider`: Generates and validates JWT tokens.
   - `JwtAuthenticationFilter`: Filters incoming requests for JWT tokens.
   - `CustomUserDetails`: Loads user details for authentication.

### Frontend

1. **Components**: Alerts, Forms, Modals, Cards, Layouts.
2. **Pages**: Home, Login, PageNotFound, CreateUser, Books, ActiveRents, etc.
3. **Routing**: Protected routes based on user roles. Example: /books for Librarians and Readers, /create-user for Admins.
4. **Contexts**: UserContext: Manages authenticated user state. AlertContext: Displays alerts and notifications.
5. **API Communication**: Custom Axios instance with JWT token interceptor.

## Authentication, Authorization and Security

### Backend

- **JWT Authentication:**
  - Users log in using their credentials (LoginDTO).
  - A JWT token is generated and returned to the client.
  - The token is included in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
- **Role-Based Access Control:**
  - Endpoints are protected using @PreAuthorize annotations.
  - Example: Only Admins can create users, while Librarians and Readers can view books.
- **HTTPS**: Ensures secure data transmission.
- **JWT Signatures**: Prevent tampering with tokens.
- **CORS**: Configures allowed origins for frontend-backend communication.

### Frontend

- **Token Storage:**
  - JWT tokens are stored in localStorage.
  - The token is automatically included in API requests using an Axios interceptor.
- **Protected Routes:**
  - Routes are protected based on user roles using RequireAuth components.
  - Unauthorized users cannot access restricted views.

## Setup and Testing the Project

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Java 21
- Maven
- Node.js and npm.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Backend setup:
   - Navigate to the backend directory `cd backend`
   - Set up MongoDB replica set by running services directly from docker-compose using IDE or by executing `docker-compose up -d` command.
   - Create a key.properties file in the src/main/resources directory: `touch src/main/resources/key.properties`
   - Add the following line to the **key.properties** file: `secret.key=your-secret-key-here` (Replace your-secret-key-here with a securely generated key. You can use a Base64-encoded string or generate a random key using a tool like RandomKeygen.)
   - Build the project: `mvn clean install`
   - Run the application: use `mvn spring-boot:run` command from REST directory in your terminal (or run main method from RestApplication class in your IDE).
3. Frontend setup:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory `cd frontend`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Testing

Access the application by opening https://localhost:5173 URL in your browser. Log in with different roles (Admin, Librarian, Reader) to test functionalities. Example accounts stored in the database after starting application:

- **Admin**:

```
email: adarsh.admin@gmail.com
password: P@ssw0rd!
```

- **Librarian**:

```
email: adarsh.librarian@gmail.com
password: P@ssw0rd!
```

- **Reader**:

```
email: adarsh.reader@gmail.com
password: P@ssw0rd!
```

You can also register as a reader using register form.

![user list page (admin view)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b33686f8-10ca-4668-9310-19daa85d09ca)
This page introduce user list view enabled for users with admin role. It allows managing registered users, including editing user data, activating/deactivating users. For users with reader role the administrator can see reader's rentals and delete non-archived rent if needed.

![book list (librarian view)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e1f9d81-4ab5-4b5b-a7a8-9f2594dafcae)
This page introduce book list view enabled for users with librarian role. It allows managing books, including editing book data, archiving books, adding new books to the library. If the book is currently rented it cannot be edited or archived.

![book list (reader view)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c06eb33-f7ca-4998-a0da-1f50e7dd2bde)
This page introduce book list view enabled for users with reader role. It allows reader to rent available books with rental period specification (rental can be in future) or without - rental begins after confirmation. If the book is currently rented it cannot be rented by any other user.

![active rents list (reader view)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b4cbe5-53de-4cd3-8877-bcad74963acc)
This page introduce active rents list view enabled for users with reader role. It allows reader to browse his active rents and ended the selected rent on request.
